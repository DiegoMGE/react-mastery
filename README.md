<h1 align="center">Mastering React 18 ‚öõ</h1>

This is for my notes from all my journey with React 18, and throught time, all this information would change to just explain what my project is.

React is a **JavaScript library** for creating _dynamic apps_ with _beatifull UI_.

## Application Structure (folders) üìÅ

- **node_modules**: all third-party libraries are installed.
- **public**: public assets from our app exists, like images, videofiles, etc.
- **src**: source code for app; components.

## Type of casing code ‚úç

There are couple types of casing code, but in React with componentes it's a good practice to use **Pascal Casing**.

```JavaScript
function Message() {
    console.log('This funciton use Pascal Casing!');
}
```

All the components in **React** has to have a close tag.

```JavaScript
<Message></Message>
```

# How React Works üìÇ

- Virtual DOM:
  - div --- h1
  - App --- Message

The **StrictMode** _render_ component identify if there are potencial problems.

# React Ecosystem üß™

There are differences between a Library and a Framework.

- **Library**: a tool that provides specific funcionality.
  - a _library_ is like a tool.
- **Framework**: a set of tools and guidelines for building apps.
  - a _framework_ is like a toolset.

The main purpose from **React** is to create amazing _UI_. For also for couple more:

- **Routing**: allow user to go from one page to another.
- **HTTP**.
- **Managing app state**.
- **Internationalization**.
- **Form validation**.
- **Animations**.

By convention, all the **components** should stay in a folder called _"components"_.

# Fragments üìö

A component _can't return more than one element_. There's a solution like **wrapping** all the elements inside a `<div>`, but there is even a better option, using the **Fragment** bracket option from _React itself_, and can be shorted with list _empty brackets_.

```Typescript
function ListGroup() {
  return (
    <>
      <ul className="list-group">
        <li className="list-group-item">An item</li>
        <li className="list-group-item">A second item</li>
        <li className="list-group-item">A third item</li>
        <li className="list-group-item">A fourth item</li>
        <li className="list-group-item">And a fifth one</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

All _children inside_ the _empty brackets_ are interpreted like using **Fragment** but without typing it.

# Rendering a List üìÉ

In React, when rendering a list of items using **.map()**, we have to assign them a _unique key_ to each one.

```Typescript
function ListGroup() {
  const items = ["New York", "San Francisco", "Tokyo", "London", "Paris"];

  return (
    <>
      <h1>List</h1>
      <ul className="list-group">
        {items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li> // This is the right way to do it
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
